                        <p class="textColor">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs
                            to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
                            businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website.
                            Using the term “official” is
                            just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better.
                            Products or websites are not
                            licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for
                            all of its merchandise. In
                            some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but
                            this is not true in New
                            Orleans.</p>

                            of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
                            however, is on a different day each year.

                            Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year.
                            Fat Tuesday is always the
                            day before Ash Wednesday.

                            Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay
                            through Ash Wednesday. Check
                            out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.</p>

                            almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one
                            extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
                            chilly morning may turn into a
                            warm afternoon.

                            Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can
                            get somewhat dirty. Don’t
                            forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want
                            to bring a raincoat!</p>

                            Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus
                            and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New
                            Orleans. The streets are packed all
                            day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday
                            (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday
                            are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that
                            Monday night, and the Zulu
                            Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and

                        <p class="textColor">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                            celebration. Those of us who grew up in New
                            Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade
                            because we used to use "taking
                            the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the
                            stuff they will catch. Throws
                            often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                            The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades
                            pass anyway). We recommend
                            seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can
                            last until 11 p.m. near the end
                            of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see
                            many families staking out
                            their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the
                            beautiful oak trees. You don't
                            have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                            You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                            Metairie, which is only 10 minutes
                            away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is
                            the parade Disneyworld
                            features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!</p>
